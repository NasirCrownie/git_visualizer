- Generates an PNG image of the repository graph.
- Allows easy inspection of repository structure and history.

## Installation

  - To install the needed dependencies to run the visualizer you will have to use the `requirements.txt` file.
  - To install the dependencies run the command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

2. **Clone the Repository**
  - Clone the repository you want to visualize using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**
- Execute the Python script and provide the path to your local Git repository:
```bash
python graph_it.py /path/to/your/repo
```

2. **View the Output**
